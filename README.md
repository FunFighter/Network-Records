# Network-Records

### Reason
We wanted to see what was going on with certian locations internet.
Having issues with our RDP we set out to record data and then use it to find where our core problem in the nextwork speed was.

### Set up
First make sure you have a working mongoDB. If you have your database located on a server you will need to edit the script. 
Goodluck :)
